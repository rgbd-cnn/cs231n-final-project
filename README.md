Key questions we need to address in the proposal:
1. What is the problem that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting?
2. What data will you use? If you are collecting new datasets, how do you plan to collect them?
3. What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations?
4. What reading will you examine to provide context and background?
5. How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?
